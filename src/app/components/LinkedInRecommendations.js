    text: "Prathmesh worked for us at azernis GmbH as a working student in software development from June 2023 to the end of January 2024. Prathmesh has made an outstanding contribution to our early-stage startup in many ways. As an early employee, he took on both frontend and infrastructure tasks and demonstrated his technical skills. Among other things, he was responsible for the implementation of a website design, improved the existing code and laid the first foundations for a cloud infrastructure in Azure. In addition to general IT knowledge, this required in-depth knowledge of JavaScript, React, nextJS and CSS. Prathmesh also demonstrated his skills in TailwindCSS, which he incorporated into the website in a refactoring on his own initiative. Prathmesh also made a positive impression with his independent way of working. Things that he did not know yet were worked out independently by him in a short time and understood down to the last detail. His intelligent questions, clever ideas and commitment made him the perfect candidate for this demanding position. Mr. Doddanawar also stood out for his ability to adapt existing designs to technical circumstances and to think ahead in terms of design.",
